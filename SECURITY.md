# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are only supported for the latest major version (currently `2.x.x`).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a small project without any funding or bounty program.

If you find a vulnerability and want to report it, open an [Advisory](https://github.com/AgustinSRG/Showdown-ChatBot/security/advisories) on the `Security` sections of the repository. Depending on the severity, it will be dealt with lower or higher priority.
