# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are only supported for the latest major version (currently `2.x.x`).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a small project without any funding or bounty program.

If you find a vulnerability and want to report it, open a bug report [Issue](https://github.com/AgustinSRG/Showdown-ChatBot/issues) on the project. Depending on the severity, it will be dealt with lower or higher priority.

If you find a critical vulnerability (remove, unauthenticated), you can contact the owner of the repository ([AgustinSRG](https://github.com/AgustinSRG)) directly by email if you consider posting the information publicly could be dangerous.
